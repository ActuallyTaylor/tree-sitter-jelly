This function should copy the complete state of your scanner into a given byte buffer,

The function is called every time the external scanner successfully recognizes a token. 
It receives a pointer to your scanner and a pointer to a buffer. 
The maximum number of bytes that you can write is given by the TREE_SITTER_SERIALIZATION_BUFFER_SIZE constant, defined 
in the tree_sitter/parser.h header file.

The data that this function writes will ultimately be stored in the syntax tree so that the scanner 
can be restored to the right state when handling edits or ambiguities. 
For your parser to work correctly, the serialize function must store its entire state, 
and deserialize must restore the entire state. 
For good performance, you should design your scanner so that its state can be serialized as 
quickly and compactly as possible.
